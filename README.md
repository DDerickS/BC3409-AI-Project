# BC3409-AI-Project Spam Detection for SMS and Email Messages
## A Proof of Concept message and email classification using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

### Problem Statement
* The number of spam texts surged by 7.1 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 85% of all emails are spam, totaling 122.33 billion messages sent globally in a single year. At least 469 people were deceived by SMS phishing scams in December 2021 that purported to be from OCBC bank. There was a loss of at least S$8.5 million as a result. Not limited to individuals, businesses are also often common targets of scammers. Since January 2022, it was revealed that businesses have lost $70.8 million as a result of commercial email leak schemes.

### Solution
* Creating a website (PI Spam) to help users make educated decisions by performing a check to see if an email or SMS communication is spam or not before making any quick decisions. Neural Network will be the chosen machine learning model as it achieved the highest accuracy rate amongst other models.

### Languages
